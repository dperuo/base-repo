## Please Follow GitHub Flow for Contributions

1. The `master` branch is always stable and deployable.

1. To work on something new, create a new branch off `master`. Give your branch a descriptive name (e.g. `new-user-sign-up`).

1. Commit early and often to your local branch. Regularly push your work to the same named branch on GitHub.

1. Open a pull request as soon as possible. Use the pull request to discuss your code and gain feedback.
